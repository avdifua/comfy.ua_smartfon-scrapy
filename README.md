# comfy.ua_smartfon-scrapy
 I go further and try to work with 'scrapy' on more complicated sites.
 This script takes data from https://comfy.ua/smartfon/
 Quantity of pages for scraping you can change in file phones_prices.py - 'for _ in range(6)'
 And of course, you can play with pauses for more quickly work.
 But if requests will be to fast then you take a temporary ban.
 This script for not of any purpose, Just for fun)
 P.S.
 For using random user-agent install this package: pip install scrapy-user-agents
